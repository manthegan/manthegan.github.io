Ever since I knew what computers were, I was fascinated by them. In high school, I took computer science and computer technology in order 
						to expand my knowledge. My favourite part about computers is programming; I love its versatility since programs can be used to do all sorts of tasks, and how I am able to use it to create amazing things. During my free time, I like to create games to improve my programming skills.
						I never knew how difficult it was to create a game until I had done it myself; countless hours were spent debugging and trying to make the code more efficient. The games I have created are quite simple as I was an amateur when it comes to programming. I hope
						the things that I create in the future will be used by people from all over the world.

		<div class="text-center" id="turingmodaltext0" style="visibility:visible"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird">Flappy bird</a> is a game that was developed by a Vietnam-based developer Nguyễn Hà Đông. In the late January of 2014, it became so popular 
		that the developer claimed to have been earning $50000 a day from in-app advertisements. During this time, I was in grade 10, and I was half-way through my first computer science
		course in High school. In this course, we are learning how to program with a very basic programming language called <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_(programming_language)">Turing</a>, and we had just finished learning how to
		create some simple animations with loops and shapes. Me and three of my classmates, Tiger, Keith, and Anthony, decided to recreate this game on Turing. Since Turing was a 
		very basic programming language, there were no objects, classes, or collision. In order to check for collision properly, we had to draw every sprite in this game such as the bird and the pipe using shapes instead of just using an image. Drawing all the images by ourselves took a while, but it was worth it since it allowed us to customize everything. This
		project took the three of us three days to complete, and I'm very proud of what we had made.
		</div>
		<div class="text-center" id="turingmodaltext1" style="visibility:hidden">My main tasks in this project were creating the pipes and the collision system. This pipe is created using a few rectangles and looks very simple.</div>
		<div class="text-center" id="turingmodaltext2" style="visibility:hidden">The next step was to create more pipes and get them to move across the screen from the right to the left. In order to be efficient, I only created three pipes and the moment
		they move to the left side of the screen, I move them back to the right side to start over again.</div>
		<div class="text-center" id="turingmodaltext3" style="visibility:hidden">The third step was the aesthetics and collision system. For the aesthetics, I drew more boxes of different colors on top of the simple pipe to create a light and shadow effect.
		The collision was the most difficult part, it took be so many trials before I finally got it right.</div>
		<div class="text-center" id="turingmodaltext4" style="visibility:hidden">The final step was putting all of our work together. Surprisingly, this part was not very difficult since we coordinated very well and
		our code fit together perfectly. Afterwards, we decided to add some little features of our own, we made it possible to change the size, speed, jump direction, and color of the bird. My favourite feature has to be the rainbow bird. From this project, I learned
		a lot about teamwork and coordination, these are crucial for a cooperative project like this one. </div>

		<div class="text-center" id="pythonmodaltext0" style="visibility:visible"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> was the programming language I learned in grade 11. It is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Unlike Turing, Python
		had classes, so creating objects became much easier and greatly reduced code repetition. <a target="_blank" href="http://pygame.org/wiki/about">Pygame</a> was used to make games with Python, it is a set of Python modules that provides crucial functions that a game needs to run properly. While
		learning Pygame and Python, I discovered a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.maplesimulator.com/node/13">website</a> that had a lot of cool animations, characters, and monsters from a game called <a target"_blank" href="http://maplestory.nexon.net/">MapleStory</a>. I decided to use these to make a game, so I can improve my programming skills. </div>
		<div class="text-center" id="pythonmodaltext1" style="visibility:hidden">I created this simple game before I knew how to use collision with Pygame. I had to create my own function that checks for collision between the arrow and the enemy. From this small project, I
		learned a lot about creating animations and making them look fluid.</div>
		<div class="text-center" id="pythonmodaltext2" style="visibility:hidden">This platform jumper was created after I had learned how to use Pygame collision functions. Every image has a rectangular shape, even though you can not see it. This made checking collision a nightmare, since the game
		thinks the character is standing on the platforms, but from our perspective, the character is in mid-air. I have become much better at animation transitions and event handling. As you can see, the character goes from the standing animation to the prone animation which occurs when I press the down key. I had learned so much about collision through this project, and I was prepared to make a much bigger game.</div>
		<div class="text-center" id="pythonmodaltext3" style="visibility:hidden">I decided that I should use all the knowledge and skills I have acquired to make a big game. My idea was to use the MapleStory monsters to create an epic battle game. There would be two sides and each side can create monsters to put into battle. All I did in this first step was making a monster from each side walk towards each other.</div>
		<div class="text-center" id="pythonmodaltext4" style="visibility:hidden">One of the biggest problems I faced while make this battle game was the transition between animations. As you can see, when it goes from attack animation to death animation, the monster moves to a completely different location, which does not make any sense.
		To fix this problem, I had to create a long list of offsets, these offsets move the monster based on its animation so that the monster looks like its in the same place.</div>
		<div class="text-center" id="pythonmodaltext5" style="visibility:hidden">After adding all the offsets for each monster, I created buttons to spawn monsters and making it fight when it meets a monster from the other side. For this version, the enemy would spawn anything that I spawn, I wanted to use this as test for monsters fighting and dying.</div>
		<div class="text-center" id="pythonmodaltext6" style="visibility:hidden">The difficult parts of the game were finished. I added a nice scrollable background, sounds, indicators, buttons, and a home base to each side. When this base is destroyed, the game is over. I have little clue on how to program AI, so the enemy just spawns random monsters at random times. I tried to make my game as efficient as possible by keeping redundant code to a minimum. For example, all of these monster objects use the same exact class because I made the class incredibly versatile. This not only saved me a lot of time in programming but it also shows just how powerful Python classes are. I am really proud of the final product of my work, I always thought creating a 2D game was easy, but after I done it myself, I understand how difficult it can be. </div>
